The team was largely self-driven and with such a large breadth of potential work it is easy for someone to become lost in the possibilities or spend too much time on activities that, although useful, do not provide as great of value.  Alex excelled at being able to identify a problem, work independently or with others explore then validate potential solutions, and constructively communicate to the group his findings - which were most often adopted.  This combination of assertiveness, sound judgment, team work, and good communication skills made him an invaluable contributor to not only his team but to the organization as a whole."

      "name": "Alvin Chow",
      "reference": "Alex was an invaluable full-stack software engineer at Tiller, and a key reason we were able to get our MVP out the door. His wide-ranging, \"generalist\" skill set was more than evident, as he capably worked on every component in the product (backend, frontend, and Android/iOS apps). In particular, Alex built out core parts of the frontend, including a number of custom UI's. He also took the initiative in making improvements to our infrastructure and processes, and was always more than willing to get involved in higher level product decisions.  Alex is very flexible and self-sufficient engineer, and very quick to pick up new things. In short, he can be counted on to get things done, and if he doesn't know how to do something he will figure it out or learn what he needs to - all while adhering to good development practices. For all his talents, Alex is very humble, and is an awesome guy to have on your team."
