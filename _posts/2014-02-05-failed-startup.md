## Brief
Tiller was a company based out of San Francisco, CA developing a solution for workforce management.  It was comprised of a website and mobile apps, but thats not what this is about.  Tiller's team decided to pack it up and call it quits in early February 2014.  It was a difficult decision.  Tiller failed, but not all was lost.  Below is a mental rambling of what I learned and how we could have done things better.

Before I get into details about my lessons learned, I want to start with why I believe Tiller failed.  We made plenty of mistakes, but the one that sticks out the most is timing.

## *Timing is Everything*
I'm not the first one to preach this, but it is so true and never more prevalent than in Tiller's scenario.  When all is said and done half of Tiller's life was spent wasted because good software engineers joined the team way too late.  Assembling a team is extremely difficult and only certain people want to work for pre-revenue startups.  On Tiller's last day I believe the team was a solid foundation that functioned well together.  With that said, I was on the team less than 6 months and another engineer was on the team for less than 1 month.  If we could do it all again things would be different, but unfortunately things don't work that way.

## Finding Tiller
I worked at a small startup based out of Detroit, MI.  I wasn't extremely happy and wanted to move on to my next venture.  That is how I ended up at Tiller.  Tiller was my first job offer after I started looking.  Here in lies my first mistake.  I want to say that my choice to join Tiller is not one that I regret, but there is always lessons to be learned.

### Shop Around
The demand for developers is insane right now.  Shooting out resumes and taking phone calls isn't that hard.  Do it for a little bit and get a feel for what is out there.  I would not recommend opening the door and closing it on your first opportunity.  Interviewing isn't always comfortable but it is an extremely valuable exercise.  The knowledge about the industry, the different benefits and compensation, and wide array of work cultures is something you cannot miss out on.

### Do your Due Diligence
Vet every and all companies you interview with.  This includes the team, the venture capitalist, the code, and the business values / mission statement.  The idea that companies are helping you by hiring you is something that is just plain wrong.  A hiring decision involves two parties, none of which are doing the other a favor.  For a young or inexperienced developer this is something hard to grasp ( at least it was for me ).  You need to be comfortable and in an environment that helps you grow, don't settle because a company has deemed you "good enough".  Ask yourself if you will enjoy waking up and working everyday.  **Find a job you love and you'll never work a day in your life.**

### Speaking From the Other Side
I was involved in a hiring decision at Tiller.  I looked at tons of résumé's and LinkedIn profiles.  I was not aware of how difficult it is to find and place talent within a company.  Experience is great, but smart people are better.  If you need an android developer, find a software engineer who has strong fundamentals.  Adopting a new technology shouldn't be a huge deal.  Make sure the technical background is good.  In most cases an android developer will eventually work on other projects especially in a smaller company.  Recognize when you need a specialist and recognise when you need a generalist.

## Life at Tiller
Working at Tiller was great.  I was a remote employee and we had a really good dynamic as a team.  I will truly miss working on Tiller's team.  Development at Tiller was a little awkward at times. It lacked focus and structure.  This was shaken up shortly after I started, and the first enormous MVP was thrown out for a much simpler version that we could ship quickly.

### MVP is for **MINIMAL** Viable Product
Tiller's original MVP was planned and documented with high fidelity mockups, but it had a ton of features.  This was something that I think everyone at Tiller realised was a problem and it was essentially why we trimmed the fat and slimmed down the MVP.  In my general opinion, most companies MVP's are much more feature-rich than they need to be.  If the great idea you have is your MVP then you probably have too many features and need to make your MVP lean and mean.  A vision for the future is good, but if you can release something without a few features .... **DO IT!**

### Estimating Software Projects is Difficult
This holds true for any individual.  Without the insight of an experienced software engineer or experienced manager / tech lead this task is nearly impossible.  Tiller's estimates were wildly off base because of some shake ups inside the company.  Getting the estimates right is hard but necessary to be fair to investors, employees, and customers.  Expectations need to be managed and managed well to be successful.

### Know Your Customers Needs
At Tiller we thought we had this figured out.  I don't think anyone releases a product that they think doesn't fill a need.  Get feedback and validate your assumptions early and often.  Customer engagement early on before the product is released can be super helpful.  Screenshots, mock-ups, and walkthrough's all give valuable insight to the exact problem being solved as well as how well the product solves it.  This goes hand in hand with the lean and mean MVP.  Get a product in front of people before it's ready and build upon what you have.

### Don't try to please everyone
Unfortunately some people will hate what you are doing no matter how perfect an idea it is.  This is something that can be discouraging, but sometimes you need to ignore it.  The tricky thing is to filter the "hate" from the "constructive criticism".  Ignore unhelpful information and forget about it.  Soak in all the constructive criticism, but **it's impossible to please everyone.**

## Calling the Game Early
Tiller had money in the bank when we decided to walk away.  This was something that is really hard to do, but sometimes it's the right thing to do.  We made the proactive decision to move on from Tiller because we watched it fail, and we knew there was no way to dig ourselves out of the whole we dug.  Running out of money wouldn't have done anyone any good.

### Be Decisive
This applies throughout the life of a company.  Making decisions quickly and staying focused can help keep employees on the same page and allow everyone to have the best knowledge available.  A small company has a lot of decisions to make.  Don't let them linger.  Don't be afraid to fail.  Some decisions will be the wrong one, but you need to find that out quickly so you can fix it.

### Have Direction
Tiller started implementing OKR's near the end of it's life, and we should have done it way earlier.  Goals / Objectives help keep employees focused and working towards the same exact common thing.  Without defining something like this it is always up for interpretation.  Put them in writing somewhere and make sure everyone knows about them.  Defining your own personal goals will also help maintain focus.  I didn't think this would help, but I was wrong.  Writing my goals down and executing on them was an awesome exercise.

## Life After Tiller
This chapter is yet to be written.  Here I stand on the hunt for a new job / opportunity.

Wish me luck.
Contact me if you have anything interesting I could be a good fit for.

I learned a lot at Tiller both from the people around me and the mistakes we made.  It was a great experience and the knowledge I take with me is very valuable.

**Can you learn anything from our mistakes?  I sure hope so.**
