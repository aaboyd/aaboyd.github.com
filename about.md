I work at iRule, a small little company in the heart of Detroit, MI. We turn your smart phone / tablet into a complete universal remote solution.

I was originally brought onto the team as a Software Engineer working on the Android side of IRule.  Since then I have been involved with iOS, Web, and Python development.

##School
![iMSU](http://aaboyd.github.io/assets/img/msu.png) ![iUniversity of Michigan - Dearborn](http://aaboyd.github.io/assets/img/umd.png)

I graduated from Michigan State University with a B.S. in Computer Science.  I had the privilege of working with Motorola Mobility on my [Senior Capstone Project](http://www.capstone.cse.msu.edu/2011-01/projects/motorola-mobility/).

After undergrad, I immediately started my graduate studies at the University of Michigan - Dearborn.  I graduated with a M.S. in Software Engineering shortly afterwards.

##Fun
I love software and all things technology.  I find myself always playing video games or on a computer of some sort, whether it be a smart phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop.

In addition to my passion for computers, I love sports, and never pass up a chance to play soccer.
