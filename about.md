## [Tiller](http://tillerapp.com)
I work at Tiller, a San Francisco based startup.

I touch code from python to Objective-C to help create a better management tool for small fields service based companies.  My focus has been on front-end development, although much of my experience has been on the backend in the past.  In addition to front-end JS, I have written extensive amounts of SASS and HTML templates.  All this while still maintaining code on the backend.

##School
![MSU](http://aaboyd.github.io/assets/img/msu.png) ![University of Michigan - Dearborn](http://aaboyd.github.io/assets/img/umd.png)

I graduated from Michigan State University with a B.S. in Computer Science.  I had the privilege of working with Motorola Mobility on my [Senior Capstone Project](http://www.capstone.cse.msu.edu/2011-01/projects/motorola-mobility/).

After undergrad, I immediately started my graduate studies at the University of Michigan - Dearborn.  I graduated with a M.S. in Software Engineering shortly afterwards.

##Fun
I love software and all things technology.  I find myself always playing video games or on a computer of some sort, whether it be a smart phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop.

In addition to my passion for computers, I love sports, and never pass up a chance to play soccer.
